Unfortunately our store, Clement Restaurant Bakery, suffered a fire in our kitchen causing our restaurant to close for the time being. We apologize for the inconvenience, but thank you for your prayers and support. Our other stores, Clement BBQ and Xiao Long Bao, will sell most of our products while we are in the process of rebuilding. 

Again I want to thank all of you, our patrons, for your continued support. Please inquire within one of our other restaurants for large/custom ours.
