  **Cooking Instructions for Frozen Dumplings**


  1. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil on high heat. There should be enough water to cover all the dumplings.

  2. Stir water and place desired amount of dumplings in the water. Stir the water again after placing the dumplings in the pot to help prevent the dumplings from sticking on the bottom of the pan.

  3. Cover the pot and allow the water to return to a rolling boil. Once at a rolling boil reduce heat to medium high heat to prevent water from overflowing. 

  4. Once the dumplings start to float, cook for another 5 minutes. Check the doneness of the dumpling by cutting into 1 dumpling and ensuring there is no pink colored meat in the middle. 

  5. Strain all dumplings and serve hot on a plate or in your own desired soup.

  6. Optional - Pan Fry 

     1. After straining, rinse the dumplings in cold water and allow to air dry while preparing a pan.
     2. Add a nice layer of oil in the pan and place on medium high heat.
     3. Once lightly heated add desired dumplings into pan. Be careful as any water entering the pan will make the hot oil splatter. 
     4. Pan fry until the sides are golden brown.
