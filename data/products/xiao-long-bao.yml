  **Frozen Xiao Long Bao Cooking Instructions**


  1. Prepare a large pot or wok with a 2 or 3 inch layer of water with a metal steaming tray at the bottom and place on high heat. You want enough water to meet the tray without going above it.

  2. Place a leaf of lettuce on the bottom of a bamboo steamer basket to prevent the dumplings from sticking. 

     * If you do not have lettuce you can poke holes in plastic wrap to allow the steam to come through. 
  3. Place dumplings in the basket allowing room for each dumpling to expand as they cook.

  4. Once the water is boiling, carefully place the basket in the pot on top of the metal tray and cover the pot. 

  5. Reduce the heat to medium.

  6. Cook for about 10 minutes and serve hot.

  7. Check the doneness by checking if there is any pink meat.
