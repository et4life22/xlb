  **Frozen Pot Stickers, Traditional Cooking Instructions**


  1. Oil pan and place on medium high heat.

  2. Place desired amount of pot stickers in the pan and fry until lightly brown.

  3. Without moving the dumplings, add a layer of about a quarter inch of water in the pan and cover to allow the dumplings to steam. 

  4. Once the water has evaporated, continue to fry the pot sticker until the bottom crisp with a nice golden brown color.

  5. Check the doneness of the pot sticker by checking if the meat is brown. If there is any pink, continue to steam until all the meat is no longer pink.

     * You can also check the non-traditional way of cooking the pot stickers by visiting our Chive/Bok Choy & Pork Dumpling product page. Follow instructions including the optional pan frying method.
